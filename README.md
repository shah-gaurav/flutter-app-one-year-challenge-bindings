# Flutter State Management Challenge

One year challenge app using Bindings state management

## Introduction

Recently I read a Flutter State Management article on Medium: [Flutter #OneYearChallenge; Scoped Model vs BloC Pattern vs States Rebuilder](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-oneyearchallenge-scoped-model-vs-bloc-pattern-vs-states-rebuilder-23ba11813a4f)

This article discussed various different state management techniques and consisted of a challenge that the author of the article solved using the [States_rebuilder](https://pub.dev/packages/states_rebuilder) state management package that the author has developed.

The current recommended Flutter state management solution from the Flutter team is the [Provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider). So I attempted to solve the challenge presented in the article using the Provider package. My attempt and subsequent failure to solve the challenge using the provider package is at [https://github.com/shah-gaurav/flutter-app-one-year-challenge](https://github.com/shah-gaurav/flutter-app-one-year-challenge)

However, this peaked my curiosity to learn more about state management in Flutter. So I decided that instead of using a package for state management, I should create state management solution from the ground up to solve the challenge. It proved to be a great learning exercise. This repository is the state management solution (that I named Bindings) that I came up with to solve the challenge.
